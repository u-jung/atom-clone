# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Access to Memory (AtoM)
project! Third-party patches and community development help keep the AtoM
project vibrant and responsive to our users' needs. We hope to simplify the
contribution process as much as possible. We have posted some simple
guidelines to help you get started. Please review these guidelines before
reporting issues or making pull requests to the AtoM project.

Thanks!

## Reporting general bugs

**If you are reporting a security vulnerability**, please consult the
instructions in our SECURITY.md file before proceeding. If you have discovered
an issue in AtoM that is **not** related to a security vulnerability, we
welcome your reports.

You can report general bugs in two ways: 

* By creating a new post in the [AtoM user forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ica-atom-users)
* By [opening an issue](https://github.com/artefactual/atom/issues) in our
  GitHub repository

Please be sure to include all the information we will need to reproduce the
issue locally. This includes:

* The version of AtoM you are using
* Basic information about your installation environment, including PHP, MySQL,
  Elasticsearch, and operating system versions
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* The resulting error or vulnerability and the expected outcome
* If there are any error logs related to the issue, please include the
  relevant parts as well

You can find useful tips on how to find this information in the Troubleshooting 
page in our documentation:

* https://www.accesstomemory.org/docs/latest/admin-manual/maintenance/troubleshooting/

Note as well that, as a community-driven open source project, we depend on our
community to be able to maintain and develop AtoM. We are committed to
including as many bug fixes as we can in each new release, but a confirmed
report is not enough alone to guarantee that a fix will be included in the
next release. If your institution is interested in sponsoring a fix, feel free
to contact Artefactual Systems for an estimate - all sponsored development
will be included in the next public release. For more information on how we
develop and maintain AtoM, please see:

We also welcome pull requests to fix issues!
